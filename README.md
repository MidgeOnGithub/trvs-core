## General
The Tomb Raider Version Swapper [TRVS] Core is a NET Standard 2.0 Class Library.
It provides various functionalities for Version Swappers for the "classic" [Tomb Raider games on speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/tomb_raider).

## Development
Each Version Swapper built with this Core should be its own .NET project repository with Core's [Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TRVS.Core/) included.
All `interface` and `abstract` classes should be implemented.
